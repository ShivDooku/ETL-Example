# ETL-Example
An example ETL project using building and weather data

This project utilized data gathered from an edX online course, NUS: DSBE001x Data Science for Construction, Architecture and Engineering, developed by Clayton Miller.
I chose this dataset as it represents a field I'm interested in, Data Science in the Built Environment. 

The names of the buildings and the weather files were edited to ensure annonymity of their real locations. 

The Raw Data folder contains the weather and meter data used.
The Images folder contains snapshots of the plotly charts created.
